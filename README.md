A Granularity-level Information Fusion Strategy on Hypergraph Transformer for Predicting Synergistic Effects of Anticancer Drugs

HypertranSynergy is a hypergraph learning network model used to predict the synergistic effect of anticancer drugs. 
It mainly includes two parts: CIE is a coarse-grained information extraction module based on hypergraph transformer, 
and FIE is a fine-grained information extraction module based on attention network. By coupling the two parts into HypertranSynergy, 
you can make the embeddings contain rich grain-level information to make prediction.
